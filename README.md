# project-j
 Project J is the idea of four developers and friends looking to design a site where you can utilize creativity along with technology to construct nature-based images. We strive to harness the power of web development tools to create beautiful things. We lovingly  built this site using HTML, CSS, JavaScriptâ€¦.. Take a moment from your busy day and create something, anything.
